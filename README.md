Key:
- R- Requird
- O- Optional
- Blank- unused

### Guid
`Guid` New Relic entity identifier. Typically the `guid` vaule from Nerd Graph.

### ListQueryFilter
`actor` `entitySearch` query string. The query string can search for an exact or fuzzy match on name, as well as searching several other attributes.

- Operators available: =, AND, IN, LIKE
- Special characters (.,;:*-_) are treated as whitespace. For example, name LIKE ':aws:' will match -aws. or foo aws.
- Tags can be referenced in multiple ways with or without backticks.

Examples:
- "name = 'MyApp (Staging)'
- "name LIKE 'MyApp' AND type IN ('APPLICATION')"
- "reporting = 'false' AND type IN ('HOST')"
- "domain IN ('INFRA', 'APM')"
- tags.Environment = 'staging' AND type IN ('APPLICATION')

### Variables
`Variables` is a JSON object of key/value pairs (string/string) that are substituted in the `Workload` string with [Moustache](#Moustache) allowing for parameterized input at the CloudFormation level.

### SourceGuid
*DUPLICATE ONLY*
The guid of the Workload to be duplicated. The presence of this field in the stack is the indication that this is a `Duplicate` rather than `Create` operation.

### DuplicateName
The `name` to apply to the duplicated Workload.

### Workload
The entire `workload` fragment from a `workloadCreate` or `workloadDuplicate`

This string is a valid GraphQL fragment representing a Workload, including the `workload: ` keyword. Your best bet is to use the
[GraphQL API Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql?#query=mutation%20%7B%0A%20%20workloadCreate%28workload%3A%20%7B%7D%29%0A%7D%0A)
to create this and then copy and paste. Your fragment will be substituted in a create or update mutation like this:
```graphql
mutation {
  workloadCreate(accountId: {{{ACCOUNTID}}}, {{{WORKLOAD}}}) {
    guid
  }
}
```
_NOTE_: the `{{{` and `}}}` are for [Moustache](#Moustache) processing.

If you use a JSON CloudFormation template you will have to stringify the GraphQL fragment. YAML CloudFormation templates should follow [YAML multi-line input rules](https://yaml-multiline.info/) and avoid stringification.


## Moustache
All text substitution is done using a [Go implementation](https://github.com/cbroglie/mustache) of the [Moustache specification](https://github.com/mustache/spec)`. [The manual is here](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), in
general all you need to know is use triple curly braces.

## Example
An example of a YAML configuration, this is valid and works:
```yaml
```

## Troubleshooting
- Error log
- `Debug` log level for mustache substitution
- Validate mutation using the [Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql)

## Building
- Install Docker
- Install Golang
- [Install the CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CFN-CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudformation-cli.html)
- `make clean build `

## Testing
- Start Docker
- Activate `cfn-cli`, usually `source ~/.virtenv/aws-cfn-cli/bin/activate`
- Build and start the container `make clean build ; sam local start-lambda --warm-containers eager`
- Run the [CloudFormation Contract Tests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/contract-tests.html) `cfn test`
- NOTE: don't use a `duplicate` configured `inputs_x_create.json` file in the same `cfn test` run as a normal `create`, things break badly. Only one test type at a time. 

## Publishing
```bash
# Double check the resulting zip file for security leaks!
cfn submit --dry-run
# Send the resource to AWS, the result is a private resource. NOTE: make clean build clears credentials from bin/
rm newrelic-cloudformation-*.zip  ; make clean build  ; cfn submit --set-default  --region us-east-1 
# Test the private resource with the sample template to ensure it works
aws cloudformation deploy  --force-upload --disable-rollback --region us-east-1 --template-file template-examples-live/live.yml --stack-name test-stack-workloads
# Tell AWS to run the Contract Tests, required for going public
aws cloudformation test-type --region us-east-1 --log-delivery-bucket newrelic--cloudformation--custom--resources --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-workload
# Check the result
aws cloudformation describe-type --region us-east-1  --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-workloads
# Also the logs are in CloudWatch. They end in .zip but are really gunzip so
# gunzip -S .zip <file>
# Publish the extension publicly AFTER pushing the final version to GitHub AND generating/tagging a release
# IMPORTANT!
#   --public-version-number (string)
#   The version number to assign to this version of the extension.
#   Use the following format, and adhere to semantic versioning when assigning a version number to your extension:
#     MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
#   For more information, see Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 .
#   If you donâ€™t specify a version number, CloudFormation increments the version number by one minor version release.
#   You cannot specify a version number the first time you publish a type. CloudFormation automatically sets the first version number to be 1.0.0 .
#
# It's a good idea to not publish until everything is ready AND version 1.0.0 is release in Git!
# KEEP IT ALL IN-SYNC!
#
# Git
#
aws cloudformation publish-type --region us-east-1  --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-workloads
aws cloudformation describe-type --region us-east-1  --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:830139413159:type/resource/newrelic-cloudformation-workloads
```
### Notes
- If you see an `Exception: Could not assume specified role...` error message in the test log then you probably have a `cfn` generated role and they're not correct. As this resource uses no other AWS resources a Role is not required.
